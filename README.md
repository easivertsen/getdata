# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The file 

run_analysis.R

in this directory extracts data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset".

The file should be located in the same directory as the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

When it is run it does the following:  

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
* Uses descriptive activity names to label the activities in the data set  
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
* Exports the tidy dataset to the file "tidy.txt"
